# Weather App - React + Vite

This is a weather application built using React and Vite that allows users to check weather conditions for different locations.

## Features
- based on freecodecamp weather-proxy api
- Real-time weather data
- Search by city name
- Display of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and conditions
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)

1. Clone the repository and then
```bash
cd weatherapp-react
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server

```

## Quick Start for Non-Programmers

To make it easier for non-programmers to start the application, we have provided a `application.bat` file. This batch file will install all the necessary packages, start the development server, and open the application in the browser.

### Creating a Shortcut for `application.bat`

1. Locate the `application.bat` file in the project directory.
2. Right-click on the `application.bat` file and select "Create shortcut".
3. Move the shortcut to a convenient location, such as your desktop.
4. Double-click the shortcut to run the batch file. This will:
   - Install all the required packages
   - Start the development server
   - Open the application in your default web browser
